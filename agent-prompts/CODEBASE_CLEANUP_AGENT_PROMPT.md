# 🧹 CloudTouch Codebase & Documentation Cleanup - Agent Instructions

**Project**: CloudTouch (Bose SoundTouch Bridge)  
**Objective**: Eliminate technical debt, remove workarounds, consolidate documentation, achieve clean architecture  
**Execution**: Sequential phases with quality gates  
**Version**: 2026-02-03

---

## 📋 MISSION OVERVIEW

After extensive refactoring iterations, the codebase contains:
- ❌ Workarounds that treat symptoms instead of root causes
- ❌ Overly complex solutions from incremental problem-solving
- ❌ Deviations from standard practices (React, FastAPI, pytest best practices)
- ❌ Technical debt from rapid prototyping
- ❌ Verbose documentation with outdated information
- ❌ Duplicated or conflicting documentation

**GOAL**: Production-ready codebase with minimal complexity, clean architecture, and concise documentation.

---

## 🎯 PHASE 0: CONTEXT ACQUISITION (30 minutes)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Real Device Tests are EXCLUDED from all automated runs!**

**Real vs. Mock Tests**:
- **Mock Tests**: Run by default (unit, integration, E2E with mock adapters)
- **Real Tests**: NEVER run automatically (require physical Bose SoundTouch hardware)
- **Separation**: Real tests marked with `@pytest.mark.real_devices` or in `tests/real/` directories
- **Execution**: Only via explicit scripts (`scripts/run-real-tests.ps1`)

**Validation**:
```powershell
# Check pytest.ini excludes real tests by default
cat backend/pytest.ini | Select-String "addopts.*not real_devices"

# Check pre-commit hook doesn't run real tests
cat pre-commit.ps1 | Select-String "real"  # Should find NO reference to real tests

# Verify real test markers
Get-ChildItem backend/tests/real/*.py | ForEach-Object { 
  Get-Content $_ | Select-String "pytestmark.*real_devices" 
}
```

**If violations found**:
- ❌ Real tests in default test run → Fix pytest.ini addopts
- ❌ Pre-commit hook runs real tests → Remove from hook
- ❌ Real tests not marked → Add `pytestmark = pytest.mark.real_devices`

### 0.1 Understand Application Purpose via Cypress E2E Tests

**Action**: Analyze Cypress test scenarios to extract:
- Core user workflows
- Business logic flow
- Feature set (device discovery, playback control, preset management, radio browsing)
- Integration points (Backend API, SoundTouch devices, RadioBrowser)

**Deliverable**: Temporary context document (1 page max):
```markdown
# CloudTouch - Application Context (TEMP)

## Purpose
[1 sentence: What does CloudTouch do?]

## User Workflows (from Cypress tests)
1. Device Discovery: [2-3 sentences]
2. Playback Control: [2-3 sentences]
3. Preset Management: [2-3 sentences]
4. Radio Browsing: [2-3 sentences]

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: [React version, key libraries]
- Backend: [FastAPI version, key dependencies]
- Testing: [Cypress, pytest, vitest versions]

## Architecture (from tests)
- API Endpoints: [list critical endpoints]
- State Management: [Redux/Context/other]
- External Services: [SoundTouch API, RadioBrowser API]
```

**Files to analyze**:
- `frontend/cypress/e2e/**/*.cy.js`
- `frontend/cypress/support/commands.js`
- `backend/tests/e2e/**/*.py`

## 🔍 PHASE 1: FRONTEND CODE ANALYSIS (60 minutes)

### 1.1 Static Code Analysis

**Tools to run**:
```powershell
# ESLint (JavaScript/React linting)
cd frontend
npm run lint -- --format json --output-file ../analysis/eslint-report.json

# Prettier (code formatting violations)
npx prettier --check "src/**/*.{js,jsx,css}" --write=false > ../analysis/prettier-violations.txt

# Dependency audit (security vulnerabilities)
npm audit --json > ../analysis/npm-audit.json

# Bundle size analysis
npm run build -- --mode production
npx vite-bundle-visualizer --analyze dist/stats.json > ../analysis/bundle-size.txt

# Dead code detection
npx unimported --init
npx unimported > ../analysis/dead-code.txt

# Cyclomatic complexity (React components)
npx es6-plato -r -d ../analysis/complexity-report src/
```

### 1.2 Manual Code Review Checklist

**Architecture Violations**:
- [ ] Are components doing too much? (>200 lines = suspect)
- [ ] Is state management consistent? (Redux vs. Context vs. local useState)
- [ ] Are side effects properly handled? (useEffect dependencies correct?)
- [ ] Is data fetching centralized? (API layer vs. scattered fetch calls)
- [ ] Are PropTypes/TypeScript used consistently?

**React Best Practices Violations**:
- [ ] Unnecessary re-renders (missing React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)?
- [ ] Keys in lists (using index as key)?
- [ ] Event handler naming (handleClick vs. onClick)?
- [ ] Conditional rendering (ternary hell vs. early returns)?
- [ ] Inline function definitions in JSX (performance issue)?

**Code Smells**:
- [ ] Magic numbers/strings (should be constants)
- [ ] Copy-pasted code (DRY violations)
- [ ] Commented-out code (delete it!)
- [ ] Console.log statements in production code
- [ ] Try-catch without proper error handling
- [ ] Empty catch blocks (error swallowing)

**Workarounds & Hacks**:
- [ ] setTimeout/setInterval for race condition fixes (symptom, not root cause)
- [ ] Multiple useEffect calls doing related things (should be one)
- [ ] Force re-renders (key={Date.now()}) - WHY?
- [ ] Prop drilling >3 levels (use Context/Redux)
- [ ] Duplicate API calls (caching missing?)

**File Structure Issues**:
- [ ] Files in wrong directories (`utils/` containing components?)
- [ ] Inconsistent naming (camelCase vs. PascalCase)
- [ ] Missing index.js for barrel exports
- [ ] Too many files in one directory (>20 = needs subdirectories)

### 1.3 Dependencies Audit

**Check for**:
- Unused dependencies (from `unimported` output)
- Outdated dependencies (run `npm outdated`)
- Duplicate dependencies (multiple versions of same lib)
- Unnecessary polyfills (if targeting modern browsers)
- Heavy libraries for simple tasks (lodash for one function?)

**Document**:
```markdown
| Dependency | Current Version | Latest | Used? | Action |
|------------|-----------------|--------|-------|--------|
| react-router-dom | 6.x | 6.y | ✅ | Keep |
| lodash | 4.17.21 | 4.17.21 | ❌ | REMOVE (only using _.debounce, replace with custom) |
```

# Import analysis (circular imports, unused imports)
pylint src/ --disable=all --enable=cyclic-import,unused-import --output-format=json > ../analysis/import-issues.json
```

### 2.2 Manual Code Review Checklist

**Clean Architecture Violations**:
- [ ] Are layers properly separated? (API → Use Cases → Domain → Adapters → Infrastructure)
- [ ] Dependencies flowing inward? (outer layers depend on inner, not vice versa)
- [ ] Domain models free of infrastructure concerns? (no SQLAlchemy in domain)
- [ ] Adapters wrapping external systems? (SoundTouch, RadioBrowser)
- [ ] Repository pattern used consistently for data access?

**FastAPI Best Practices Violations**:
- [ ] Dependency injection used properly? (Depends() for shared resources)
- [ ] Request validation with Pydantic models?
- [ ] Response models defined (not returning raw dicts)?
- [ ] HTTP status codes correct (201 for creation, 204 for deletion)?
- [ ] Error handling with HTTPException?
- [ ] Background tasks for long operations?
- [ ] API versioning strategy (/api/v1/)?

**Python Code Smells**:
- [ ] God classes (>300 lines, doing too much)
- [ ] Long functions (>50 lines)
- [ ] Too many parameters (>4 = use dataclass)
- [ ] Mutable default arguments (`def func(items=[])`)?
- [ ] Bare except clauses (`except:` without exception type)
- [ ] Global variables (except constants)
- [ ] String concatenation in loops (use f-strings or join)
- [ ] Import * (from module import *)

**Async/Await Issues**:
- [ ] Blocking I/O in async functions (requests instead of httpx)
- [ ] Missing await on async calls
- [ ] Unnecessary async (function doesn't do I/O)
- [ ] Mixing sync and async code incorrectly

**Workarounds & Hacks**:
- [ ] Sleep/delay to avoid race conditions (symptom fix)
- [ ] Try-except to hide errors (proper error handling?)
- [ ] Hardcoded timeouts (should be configurable)
- [ ] Duplicate code (extract to utils/shared modules)

**Configuration Issues**:
- [ ] Hardcoded values (should be in config/env vars)
- [ ] Secrets in code (use environment variables)
- [ ] Config scattered across files (centralize in config.py)
- [ ] No validation of config values (Pydantic Settings)

### 2.3 Dependencies Audit

**Check for**:
- Unused dependencies (from vulture output)
- Outdated dependencies (`pip list --outdated`)
- Conflicting versions in requirements.txt vs pyproject.toml
- Missing version pins (should pin all dependencies)
- Development dependencies in production requirements

**Document**:
```markdown
| Dependency | Current | Latest | Used? | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| httpx | 0.24.1 | 0.27.0 | ✅ | UPDATE |
| libsoundtouch | local | N/A | ✅ | Keep |
| pytest-mock | 3.11.1 | 3.12.0 | ❌ | REMOVE (not used, using unittest.mock) |
```

### 2.4 Deliverable: Backend Analysis Report

**Format** (max 3 pages, same structure as Frontend report)

---

## 🔍 PHASE 3: TEST SUITE ANALYSIS (60 minutes)

### 3.1 Frontend Tests (Vitest + Cypress)

**Static Analysis**:
```powershell
cd frontend

# Test coverage
npm run test:coverage -- --reporter=json > ../analysis/vitest-coverage.json

# Cypress test results
npx cypress run --reporter json > ../analysis/cypress-results.json

# Test file analysis (unused test files)
npx unimported --init --entry "tests/**/*.test.{js,jsx}"
```

**Manual Review Checklist**:
- [ ] Test coverage >80%? (check htmlcov/ or coverage report)
- [ ] Are tests testing implementation or behavior? (should be behavior)
- [ ] Flaky tests? (intermittent failures)
- [ ] Tests with hardcoded waits (cy.wait(5000) = bad)
- [ ] Tests without assertions (pointless tests)
- [ ] Over-mocking (mocking everything defeats the purpose)
- [ ] Under-mocking (calling real APIs in unit tests = integration test)
- [ ] Duplicate test cases (same thing tested multiple ways)
- [ ] Missing edge cases (null, empty, error scenarios)
- [ ] Test names unclear (should describe what's being tested)

**Test Quality Issues**:
- [ ] AAA pattern followed? (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- [ ] One assertion per test? (or logically grouped assertions)
- [ ] Tests independent? (can run in any order)
- [ ] Tests deterministic? (no random values, no Date.now())
- [ ] Proper cleanup (afterEach hooks for state reset)

### 3.2 Backend Tests (pytest)

**Static Analysis**:
```powershell
cd backend

# Test coverage with branch coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=json --cov-report=html --cov-branch > ../analysis/pytest-coverage.txt

# Test duration analysis (slow tests)
pytest --durations=20 --durations-min=1.0 > ../analysis/slow-tests.txt

# Test collection (find uncollected test files)
pytest --collect-only -q > ../analysis/pytest-collection.txt
```

**Manual Review Checklist**:
- [ ] Test coverage >80%?
- [ ] Async tests properly marked (@pytest.mark.asyncio)?
- [ ] Fixtures reused (not duplicated across files)?
- [ ] Fixtures scope correct (function vs. module vs. session)?
- [ ] Mocking external services (SoundTouch API, RadioBrowser)?
- [ ] Database transactions rolled back (no test pollution)?
- [ ] Proper exception testing (pytest.raises)?
- [ ] Parametrize used for similar test cases?
- [ ] Test docstrings explain intent?

**Test Smells**:
- [ ] Tests longer than code being tested
- [ ] Tests with complex setup (extract to fixtures)
- [ ] Tests skipped without reason (@pytest.mark.skip without reason)
- [ ] Tests marked as xfail (expected to fail = technical debt)
- [ ] Slow tests (>1s for unit test = probably integration test)

### 3.3 Deliverable: Test Analysis Report

**Format** (max 2 pages):
```markdown
# Test Suite Analysis Report

```

---

## 📚 PHASE 4: DOCUMENTATION CLEANUP (45 minutes)

### 4.1 Documentation Inventory

**Scan all docs**:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path docs,README.md,CONTRIBUTING.md,backend/README.md,frontend/README.md -Recurse -Include *.md | 
  Select-Object FullName, Length, LastWriteTime |
  Export-Csv -Path analysis/docs-inventory.csv
```

**Categorize each document**:

| Document | Category | Status | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| README.md | Essential | Current | **CONSOLIDATE** (remove setup duplication) |
| docs/ITERATION_2.5.1_COMPLETE.md | Archive | Completed | **DELETE** (iteration done) |
| docs/MIGRATION_PROMPT.md | Archive | Obsolete | **DELETE** (migration done) |
| backend/bose_api/README.md | Reference | Current | **KEEP** (still needed) |
| docs/TESTING_REQUIREMENTS.md | Process | Current | **CONSOLIDATE** into CONTRIBUTING.md |
| docs/SoundTouchBridge_Projektplan.md | Planning | Obsolete | **DELETE** (historical, not actionable) |

**Categories**:
- **Essential**: README, CONTRIBUTING, API docs (KEEP, consolidate if needed)
- **Reference**: API schemas, architecture diagrams (KEEP if current, DELETE if obsolete)
- **Process**: Testing guides, development workflows (CONSOLIDATE into main docs)
- **Archive**: Iteration logs, migration notes, meeting notes (**DELETE ALL - NO ARCHIVE**)
- **Redundant**: Duplicate information (MERGE into canonical source)

### 4.2 Documentation Quality Criteria

**Each document MUST**:
- ✅ Be <10 minutes reading time (~2000 words max)
- ✅ Have clear purpose (stated in first paragraph)
- ✅ Be current (last update <3 months, or mark as outdated)
- ✅ Have unique information (no duplicates)
- ✅ Use concise language (no fluff, no repetition)
- ✅ Include code examples ONLY where essential (not for illustration)
- ✅ Have actionable content (if it doesn't guide a decision, delete it)

**PROHIBITED**:
- ❌ "Background" or "History" sections (nobody cares, delete)
- ❌ Long code examples (link to real code instead)
- ❌ Verbose explanations ("as we discussed earlier", "it's important to note")
- ❌ Redundant information (if it's in code comments, don't repeat in docs)
- ❌ Future plans (use GitHub Issues instead)
- ❌ Apologetic language ("this might not be perfect but...")

### 4.3 Documentation Cleanup Actions

**For each document, decide**:

1. **DELETE** (no questions asked):
   - Iteration logs (ITERATION_*.md)
   - Migration guides (MIGRATION_*.md)
   - Meeting notes
   - Old architecture docs (if superseded)
   - Draft documents
   - Test coverage reports (data is in htmlcov/)

2. **CONSOLIDATE** (merge into canonical source):
   - Multiple README files → One main README
   - Scattered testing docs → CONTRIBUTING.md
   - Deployment guides → DEPLOYMENT.md (one file)
   - Multiple API docs → backend/API.md

3. **REWRITE** (reduce to essentials):
   - Remove verbose intros
   - Keep only actionable content
   - Replace long examples with links to code
   - Use bullet points, not paragraphs
   - Add table of contents if >1000 words

4. **KEEP AS-IS** (rare):
   - backend/bose_api/README.md (concise reference)
   - LICENSE, NOTICE (legal requirement)

### 4.4 Documentation Structure (Target State)

## Phase 4.4: Scripts & Config Audit - "Assume Idiots Worked Here"

**⚠️ CRITICAL MINDSET: Question EVERYTHING. The previous developers were probably idiots who copy-pasted without understanding.**

### 4.4.1 Executable Scripts Audit

**Find all scripts**:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path scripts/,deployment/,. -Include *.ps1,*.sh,*.py -Recurse | 
  Select-Object Name, Directory, Length, LastWriteTime |
  Export-Csv -Path analysis/scripts-inventory.csv
```

**For EACH script, answer**:
1. **What does it do?** (read the code, not just the header comment)
2. **Does it still work?** (run it, don't assume)
3. **Is it redundant?** (does another script/npm command do the same?)
4. **Is it outdated?** (references old paths, deleted files, wrong ports?)
5. **Should it even exist?** (or is this workflow obsolete?)

**Validation Checklist per Script**:
- [ ] Header comment matches actual functionality
- [ ] All referenced paths exist
- [ ] All referenced commands/tools are installed
- [ ] Error handling present (not just `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"`)
- [ ] Actually tested (run it, don't guess)
- [ ] Not duplicate of npm script or other script
- [ ] Still relevant to current workflow

**Common Script Smells**:
- ❌ References to deleted directories (`frontend-archive/`, `prototypes/`)
- ❌ Hardcoded ports that don't match current config
- ❌ Comments like "TODO: Update this" (it was never updated)
- ❌ Try-catch blocks that silently fail
- ❌ Functions that are never called
- ❌ Copy-paste from Stack Overflow without adaptation
- ❌ "Working around a bug in X" (bug probably fixed, workaround now causes bugs)

**Script Cleanup Actions**:

| Script | Status | Action | Reason |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| `scripts/run-all-tests.ps1` | ✅ Valid | **KEEP** | Runs unit + e2e, works |
| `scripts/run-real-tests.ps1` | ✅ Valid | **KEEP** | Specifically for real hardware |
| `scripts/old-deployment.ps1` | ❌ Broken | **DELETE** | References deleted `docker-compose-old.yml` |
| `deployment/deploy-local.ps1` | ⚠️ Redundant | **CONSOLIDATE** | Merge into `deploy-to-server.ps1` |

### 4.4.2 Configuration Files Audit - "Do We Really Need This?"

**Inventory ALL config files**:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path . -Include *.json,*.yaml,*.yml,*.toml,*.ini,*.config.js,*.config.ts,.env*,.gitignore -Recurse -Depth 3 |
  Select-Object Name, Directory |
  Sort-Object Directory, Name
```

**For EACH config file, validate**:

#### **package.json / pyproject.toml - Dependencies**

**Questions**:
- ❓ Is this dependency actually used? (run `unimported` or `vulture`)
- ❓ Why this specific version? (can we upgrade? is pin necessary?)
- ❓ Do we need the entire library? (using lodash for 1 function?)
- ❓ Is there a lighter alternative? (moment.js vs. date-fns)
- ❓ Is this a dev dependency in production section? (mixing test libs with runtime libs)

**Example Audit**:
```json
// package.json - BEFORE (idiot mode)
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.21",          // ❌ Used only for _.debounce - 24KB for 1 function!
    "moment": "^2.29.4",            // ❌ Not used anywhere (leftover from prototype)
    "react-router-dom": "^6.20.0", // ✅ Actually used
    "axios": "^1.6.0"              // ⚠️ Also have fetch - pick ONE
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vitest": "^1.0.0",            // ✅ Test runner
    "cypress": "^13.0.0",          // ⚠️ Do we need BOTH vitest AND cypress? (yes, different purposes)
    "react": "^18.2.0"             // ❌ Should be in dependencies, not devDependencies!
  }
}

// package.json - AFTER (professional)
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",            // ✅ Moved from devDependencies
    "react-router-dom": "^6.20.0", // ✅ Keep
    // Removed: lodash (replaced with custom debounce)
    // Removed: moment (not used)
    // Removed: axios (use fetch API)
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vitest": "^1.0.0",            // ✅ Unit tests
    "cypress": "^13.0.0"           // ✅ E2E tests (different purpose than vitest)
  }
}
```

#### **Test Configuration Files**

**Files to audit**:
- `pytest.ini` - Is coverage threshold realistic? Are markers used?
- `vitest.config.js` - Do we need setup files? Are paths correct?
- `cypress.config.js` - Are viewport sizes current? Is baseUrl correct?
- `.coveragerc` / `coverage.json` - Duplicate config with pytest.ini?

**Critical Checks**:
- [ ] All paths in config exist
- [ ] No duplicate configs (e.g., coverage settings in 3 different files)
- [ ] Timeout values are realistic (not 1ms, not 5 minutes)
- [ ] Mock/stub paths point to existing files
- [ ] Excluded paths still make sense (excluding important code?)

**Example - pytest.ini**:
```ini
# BEFORE (copy-paste from tutorial)
[pytest]
testpaths = tests  # ✅ Good
asyncio_mode = auto  # ✅ Good
addopts = -v --strict-markers --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80  # ❌ BAD! Coverage should be optional

# AFTER (professional)
[pytest]
testpaths = tests
asyncio_mode = auto
addopts = -m "not real_devices"  # ✅ Exclude real hardware tests by default
# Coverage: Run explicitly with `pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80`
```

#### **Build Configuration (vite.config.js, etc.)**

**Questions**:
- ❓ Are all plugins actually needed?
- ❓ Are build paths correct?
- ❓ Is output directory used anywhere?
- ❓ Are optimizations cargo-cult (copied without understanding)?

**Red Flags**:
- ❌ Comments like "not sure if needed but doesn't hurt" (DELETE IT THEN!)
- ❌ Experimental features enabled "just in case"
- ❌ Output to multiple directories (pick ONE)
- ❌ Sourcemaps disabled "for performance" (enable in dev, disable in prod properly)

#### **.env / .env.example**

**Validate**:
- [ ] All variables in `.env.example` are documented (what they do, valid values)
- [ ] No secrets in `.env.example` (only placeholders)
- [ ] All variables in `.env.example` are actually read by code
- [ ] No variables read by code but missing from `.env.example`

**Example**:
```bash
# .env.example - BEFORE (idiot mode)
API_URL=http://localhost:8000  # ❌ Not used anywhere in code
DEBUG=true                     # ❌ Ambiguous (what does this enable?)
SECRET_KEY=changeme            # ⚠️ Better: SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here

# .env.example - AFTER (professional)
# Backend API URL (default: http://localhost:7778)
CT_API_URL=http://localhost:7778

# Log level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR (default: INFO)
CT_LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Discovery timeout in seconds (default: 10)
CT_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT=10
```

### 4.4.3 Git Configuration Audit

**Files to check**:
- `.gitignore` - Is it ignoring what it should? Are patterns too broad?
- `.gitattributes` - Is LF/CRLF handling correct?
- Pre-commit hooks - Do they actually run? Are they fast enough?

**Gitignore Validation**:
```bash
# Find files that are ignored but shouldn't be:
git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard

# Find files tracked that should be ignored:
git ls-files | grep -E "node_modules|__pycache__|\.pyc$|\.env$"
```

**Pre-commit Hook Validation**:
- [ ] Runs in <60 seconds (or developers will use `--no-verify`)
- [ ] Doesn't run **real device tests** (only mock/unit tests)
- [ ] Fails fast (don't run E2E if linting fails)
- [ ] Clear error messages (what failed, how to fix)

### 4.4.4 Docker/Deployment Config Audit

**Files**:
- `Dockerfile` (frontend + backend)
- `docker-compose.yml`
- Deployment scripts (`deploy-to-server.ps1`)

**Critical Questions**:
- ❓ Are base images pinned to specific versions? (not `python:latest`)
- ❓ Are multi-stage builds optimized? (minimal final image size)
- ❓ Are secrets handled correctly? (not hardcoded in Dockerfile)
- ❓ Are ports documented and consistent? (code vs. Docker vs. scripts)

**Example - Dockerfile**:
```dockerfile
# BEFORE (idiot mode)
FROM python:latest  # ❌ Unpinned version
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt  # ❌ No caching, slow rebuilds
COPY . .  # ❌ Copies everything (including .git, node_modules)

# AFTER (professional)
FROM python:3.13-slim  # ✅ Pinned version
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt  # ✅ Cache layer
COPY backend/src ./src  # ✅ Only production code
```

### 4.4.5 Deliverable: Scripts & Config Cleanup Plan

# Scripts & Config Cleanup Plan

## Scripts to DELETE
- [ ] `scripts/old-deployment.ps1` - References deleted docker-compose-old.yml
- [ ] `deployment/export-image-old.ps1` - Duplicate of export-image.ps1
- [ ] `frontend/build-debug.ps1` - Never used, vite has debug mode built-in

Total: [N] scripts deleted

## Scripts to FIX
| Script | Issue | Fix |
|--------|-------|-----|
| `run-all-tests.ps1` | Includes real tests | Add `-m "not real_devices"` to pytest call |
| `deploy-local.ps1` | Hardcoded port 8000 | Use config from .env |

## Config Files to CONSOLIDATE
- Merge `.coveragerc` into `pytest.ini` (duplicate coverage config)
- Remove `vitest.setup.old.js` (replaced by vitest.config.js)

## Dependencies to REMOVE
### Frontend (package.json)
- `lodash` (24KB) → Replace with custom debounce (0.5KB)
- `moment` → Not used anywhere, DELETE

### Backend (requirements.txt)
- `requests` → Already have httpx (async), use that
- `pyyaml` → Only used in 1 test, mock it instead

## Config Issues to FIX
- `pytest.ini`: Move coverage to optional (not in addopts)
- `.env.example`: Add missing CT_MANUAL_DEVICE_IPS variable
- `vite.config.js`: Remove unused plugin `vite-plugin-pwa`
```

## 🛠️ PHASE 5: CLEANUP EXECUTION (120 minutes)

### 5.1 Frontend Cleanup Tasks

**Priority Order**:
1. **Critical issues** (blocking production)
2. **Security issues** (npm audit findings)
3. **Architecture violations** (wrong dependencies, state management mess)
4. **Code smells** (magic numbers, duplication)
5. **Dependencies** (remove unused, update outdated)
6. **Dead code** (remove unused files/functions)
7. **Formatting** (run Prettier)

**For each issue**:
```markdown
### Issue: [Title from analysis report]
- **Fix**: [Exact code change]
- **Test**: [How to verify fix works]
- **Commit**: `refactor(frontend): [description]`
```

**Execute**:
```powershell
# Fix linting issues
npm run lint -- --fix

# Format code
npx prettier --write "src/**/*.{js,jsx,css}"

# Remove unused dependencies
npm uninstall [list from analysis]

# Update dependencies (safe updates only)
npm update --save

# Re-run tests
npm run test
npm run test:e2e

# Verify no regressions
npm run build
```

### 5.2 Backend Cleanup Tasks

**Priority Order**:
1. **Security issues** (Bandit, Safety findings)
2. **Critical bugs** (type errors, logic errors)

4. **Code smells** (god classes, long functions)
5. **Dependencies** (remove unused, update safe)
6. **Dead code** (remove unused modules)
7. **Formatting** (run Black, isort)

**Execute**:
```powershell
# Fix auto-fixable issues
ruff check src/ tests/ --fix

# Format code
black src/ tests/
isort src/ tests/

# Remove unused dependencies
# (manual: edit pyproject.toml, then:)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

Remove-Item [list from analysis]

# Refactor slow tests (mock external calls)
# Refactor flaky tests (remove hardcoded waits)

# Re-run with strict coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80 --cov-branch

# Check for test leaks
pytest -x --lf
```

### 5.4 Documentation Cleanup Tasks

**Execute**:
```powershell

## 🚨 EXCEPTION HANDLING

### What if Analysis Reveals MAJOR Architectural Problems?

**Scenario**: Layer violations everywhere, state management chaos, test coverage <50%

**Action**:
1. **STOP cleanup execution**
2. **Document findings** in `CRITICAL_ISSUES.md`
3. **Propose refactoring plan** with estimated effort
4. **Get user approval** before proceeding
5. **Execute in phases** (not one big cleanup)

**Example**:
```markdown
# CRITICAL: Frontend State Management Chaos

## Problem
- Redux used in 3 components
- Context used in 5 components
- Local useState in 15 components
- Prop drilling 5 levels deep in 2 places

## Impact
- Hard to maintain
- Unclear data flow
- Duplicate state
- Race conditions

## Proposed Solution
**Option 1**: Standardize on Redux (2 days effort)
**Option 2**: Standardize on Context (1 day effort)
**Option 3**: Hybrid (Redux for global, Context for features) (1.5 days)

## Recommendation
Option 2 (Context) - simplest, fits project size

## Next Steps
1. USER APPROVAL REQUIRED
2. Create separate refactoring branch
3. Migrate incrementally (one feature at a time)
4. Update tests after each migration
5. Merge when all tests pass
```

### What if Tests Start Failing During Cleanup?

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. Did cleanup introduce a bug? → **REVERT**, fix properly
2. Was test relying on implementation detail? → **FIX TEST** (test behavior, not implementation)
3. Was test flaky to begin with? → **FIX TEST** (remove race conditions)

**Never**:
- ❌ Skip failing tests
- ❌ Mark as xfail
- ❌ Lower coverage threshold

**Always**:
- ✅ Understand why test failed
- ✅ Fix root cause
- ✅ Add regression test if needed

### What if Dependencies Can't Be Updated?

**Scenario**: Dependency X has breaking changes, major refactor needed

**Action**:
1. **Document** in `DEPENDENCIES.md`:
   ```markdown
   ## Pinned Dependencies
   
   ### httpx==0.24.1 (pinned, not latest 0.27.0)
   **Reason**: Version 0.25+ changed async API, requires refactoring all API calls
   **Impact**: Missing performance improvements, security patches
   **Plan**: Upgrade in Q2 2026 (dedicated refactoring sprint)
   **Tracking**: Issue #123
   ```

2. **Add to backlog**, don't block cleanup

### What if User Wants to Keep "Archive" Docs?

**Push back gently**:
```
"Archive documents create maintenance burden and confusion. 
Historical context belongs in git history, not docs.

If specific information is valuable:
1. Extract essential facts
2. Add to relevant current doc
3. Delete archive

What specific information from [doc] do you need to preserve?"
```

**If user insists**:
- Create `docs/archive/` folder
- Add `README.md` with warning: "Historical docs, may be outdated"
- Never link to archive from main docs
